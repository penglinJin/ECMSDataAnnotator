    <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The initial goal of this project is to annotate ASCII files, which is the most basic and important feature.</li>
      <li>In addition, as part of this project or as a follow up project, our tool should also add the ability to tag images.</li>
      <li>Our project is based on web development in java language, the backend will be developed using SpringBoot framework for functionality and the front-end pages will be developed using Vue.js framework. </li>
      <li>The basic functionality of the project includes simple registration, login and role management</li>
      <li>Users can upload .txt files and json format files and images, and then manually annotate these datasets and images. </li>
      <li>Collaborative annotation features can be implemented between users on the web page.</li>
      <li>We will also add and improve the natural language pre-processing related functions, so that the machine will annotate all the datasets for us in advance when we need it,</li>
      <li>and the annotator only needs to check whether those annotations need to be modified.</li>
    </ul>
